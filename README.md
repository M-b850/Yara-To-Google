### What the heck is this?

The funny thing is, i was lazy as hell and I didn't want to check my university's website every day for deadlines, so i wrote this to collect all the practices and add them to my google calendar.

### What do I need to do?

~~~~~~~~
git clone https://github.com/M-b850/Yara-To-Google.git
cd Yara-To-Google
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 yara
~~~~~~~~
